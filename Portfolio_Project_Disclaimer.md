### **Project Title: Loan Portfolio Risk & Profitability Optimization: A Strategic Data Analysis for First National Bank Texas**

**Author:** Daniel Rodriguez III, Data Analyst Portfolio Project

**Date:** 18 December 2025

**1. Purpose and Intent**
This project is a personal data analytics portfolio piece designed to demonstrate proficiency in data engineering, risk modeling, and strategic storytelling. It is strictly for educational and demonstrative purposes. This project is not commissioned by, affiliated with, or endorsed by First National Bank Texas (FNBT) or its subsidiaries. The analysis and recommendations contained herein are the independent work of the author.

#### **2. Data Integrity and Synthetic Generation**
All data utilized in this project is synthetic. While the figures—including the $15.4B portfolio valuation and the specific loan distributions—are designed to mirror large-scale commercial banking operations, they do not represent the actual internal records, private financial statements, or confidential customer data of First National Bank Texas.

**Research & Framework:** The synthetic dataset was architected using a rigorous research framework to ensure industry realism. This involved:

* **Public Financial Research:** Analyzing publicly available "Call Reports" (FFIEC) and Annual Reports (10-K equivalents) to understand standard debt-to-income ratios, Loan-to-Value (LTV) benchmarks, and regional concentration trends common in Texas-based mid-to-large cap banks.

* **Industry Challenges:** The data accounts for real-world economic challenges, such as the post-pandemic volatility in the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Office sector and geographic concentration risks inherent in high-growth Texas metros like Killeen-Temple.

* **Algorithmic Generation:** Data points were generated using Python-based simulations to create statistically significant correlations between credit scores, interest rates, and risk grades.

#### **3. Representation of Entities**
The use of the name "First National Bank Texas" and references to specific geographic regions (e.g., Killeen, TX) are based on publicly available information regarding the bank’s market presence. This project does not intend to:

* Misrepresent the financial health, stability, or operational practices of First National Bank Texas.

* Disclose or utilize any proprietary or non-public banking secrets.

* Provide actual financial advice or investment ratings for the mentioned entity.

#### **4. "Safe Balance" Program & Recommendations**
The "Safe Balance" outreach strategy, the "Target Risk Ceiling," and the specific risk scores (e.g., 1.24 average) are conceptual frameworks developed by the author to showcase problem-solving capabilities. These strategies are hypothetical and should not be interpreted as existing internal policies of FNBT.
