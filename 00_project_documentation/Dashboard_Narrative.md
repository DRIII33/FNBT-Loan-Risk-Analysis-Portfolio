## **Business Scenario**

The First National Bank Texas (FNBT) is navigating a period of regional economic shifts and rising interest rates. The executive leadership team requires a transparent, real-time method to monitor the $15.4B portfolio to ensure lending standards remain aligned with the bank’s risk appetite. This dashboard serves as the primary intelligence tool for the Board Risk Committee to oversee asset quality and regional exposure.

## **Business Problem**
Prior to this analysis, risk reporting was fragmented across multiple departments, leading to:

* **Lagging Indicators:**
Difficulties in identifying "stress zones" in the CRE sector before delinquency occurred.

* **Concentration Blind Spots:**
A lack of granular visibility into the risk profile of specific metros like Killeen, TX.

* **Missed Retention Opportunities:**
Inability to efficiently identify low-risk customers for the "Safe Balance" outreach program.
